micro:bit Teleporting Duck
--------------------
In this assignment you and a partner will program two micro:bits to make a duck fly invisibly through the air from one micro:bit to another.

Like the previous Wireless Intruder program, this one uses the micro:bit’s radio function to send data from one micro:bit to another when the accelerometer detects a shake gesture. The program first configures the radio and sets its group. It doesn’t matter what group you pick as long as your partner’s micro:bit is using the same group number, and no-one else nearby is using the same group. When you shake your microbit, it sends the word ‘DUCK’ on that radio group and clears the screen. If either micro:bit receives the radio 'DUCK' message, a duck icon appears on its display, so you should only ever have 1 duck visible at any time.

Program requirements
-----------------
* Your program must use the micro:bit's sensor and radio features
* Each person will submit the Python code for their program and an animated gif showing the two programs running to Google Classroom
